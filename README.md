# Android Development
For 6 months I did Android App Development but it was kind of hectic as because it had to many bugs and errors to clear and I was not that much compatible with it .I didn't do any course it just the random Youtube videos with which I learned all these things and then I pursuaded my way to Web Development and Recently I created the Quiz app for my project in software engineering . I have made notes app with shared preferences but it has some bugs for which I have to use Hash map but I not able to use it correctly.
